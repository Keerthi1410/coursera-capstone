    "Dataset with the name Chicago Public schools has got columns like school name, type of school(Elementary, Middle, or High School), street address, city, state and zipcode of schools, school certificate(healthy or not),Safety icon,safety score, average performance of the students, misconduct rate of students, student to teacher ratio, community area name, police distrcit and many other details. I will be not using all the columns for analysis however, only the required columns are retained and unwanted columns will be dropped. During the analysis, address columns are used to generate geocodes using foursquare API and other columns like safety score, healthy_school_certified,misconduct rate of students will be primely considered in order to suggest the best school to the parents. This particular dataset is available online. For convenience, I  downloaded the dataset and below is the dataset I imported."
